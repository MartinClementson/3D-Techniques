# 3D- Project

This project was done during a course called 3D-Programming. 
The project contains various rendering techniques.


Included techniques are

  - phong shading
  - Pivot transformation
  - .md5mesh import
  - .md5anim import
  - .obj import
  - Dynamic cube mapping
  - Quad tree culling
  - Frustum culling
  - Height map geometry generation
  - Gaussian blur post process with compute shader
  - Render to texture function, (used for dynamic cube mapping)
  - Skeletal animation
  - Normal mapping
  - Skybox render
