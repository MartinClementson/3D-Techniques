/*
Shader Resources.

Note: This is subject of change. As we start implementing maps like normal maps, and hight maps 
that needs to be updated with each individual model, we will have to keep those indices close to eachother.

Eventually, all the static resources such as the sky map, will have an index further back.

The index is as of now : (Update this if anything is changed!)

0 = is the index that is being replaces each object with the objects texture map.
1 = is the skymap texture, It is set on initialization and should (for now) not be changed during run time.
2 = Is the render to texture resource, It works, just not implemented in a way that demonstrates it.
3 = the cubemap for the dynamic cube map
